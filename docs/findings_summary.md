# Findings Summary — Delivery Performance & Customer Experience

This analysis examines how delivery performance affects customer satisfaction, loyalty, and regional operational risk using three core visualisations.

---

## Business Question

**How does late delivery impact customer experience and where should Olist prioritise operational interventions?**

---

## Visualisation 1 — Delivery Delay vs Customer Satisfaction

**Key finding:**
- Average review scores decline sharply once deliveries exceed ~3 days late.
- On-time / early deliveries average ~4.3 out of 5.
- Deliveries delayed 8+ days drop to ~1.7 out of 5.

**Interpretation:**
Customer satisfaction is **highly sensitive to delivery delays**, with a clear threshold after which sentiment deteriorates rapidly.

---

## Visualisation 2 — Delivery Delay vs Repeat Purchase Rate

**Key finding:**
- Repeat purchase rates decline gradually as delivery delays increase.
- On-time customers repeat at ~6.6–6.8%
- Customers with 8+ day delays repeat at ~5.7–6.0%

**Interpretation:**
Loyalty erosion is **slower and less visible** than satisfaction decline, making it a lagging indicator of delivery performance issues.

## Visualisation 3 — Regional Late Delivery Risk Map

**Key finding:**
- Late delivery risk is unevenly distributed across regions.
- States RR (Roraima), SE (Sergipe), and AP (Amapá) show the highest combined:
  - Frequency of late deliveries
  - Severity of delays when late

**Risk Score Definition:**
Late Risk Score =  
**(% of late orders) × (average days late when late)**

This represents the expected number of late-delivery days per order.

---

## Overall Insights

1. Customer satisfaction reacts immediately to late delivery.
2. Loyalty degradation emerges gradually and is harder to detect early.
3. Regional performance varies significantly and requires targeted intervention.

---

## Business Implications

- Delivery performance should be treated as a **leading indicator of customer experience**
- Monitoring review score decline enables earlier intervention than loyalty metrics
- Regional prioritisation allows efficient allocation of logistics resources

---

## Priority Focus Areas

Based on volume and risk severity:
- **RR, SE, AP** should be prioritised for:
  - Logistics partner review
  - Delivery SLA tightening
  - Regional capacity or routing optimisation
